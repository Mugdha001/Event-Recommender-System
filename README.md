## Project Ideas for CMPE 272 - approved idea

### Evento
Project Description:
Through Evento you can create, predict number of attendees, find and attend events that fuel your passion. Whatâ€™s unique in Evento is that, apart from suggesting recommendations hand-picked for you, it also predicts how many users will be interested for the event you are thinking of hosting! Using our prediction, you are able to view the number of people even before you host it online, and hence you can plan your events and resources needed for them much efficiently.

### Proposed Solution:

Datataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/event-recommendation-engine-challenge
Search operation: Show results for the keywords searched by users.
Event hosting and prediction of count: Host events by entering event-details. View prediction of number of users interested in this event
Event Recommendation: A logged-in user can view recommendations, which the application suggests based on the past events attended by user

### Technology: MongoDB-Express-React-NodeJS stack, IBM Watson Studio for Data Refinery and Machine Learning
