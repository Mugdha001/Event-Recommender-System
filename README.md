### MeetUp
### Project Description:
Through Meet-Up you can create, find and attend events that fuel your passion. Whatâ€™s unique in Meet-up is that apart from suggesting recommendations hand-picked for you, it also predicts footfall expected for the event you are thinking of hosting! Using our footfall prediction, you can plan your events and resources needed for them much efficiently.
### Proposed Solution
Datataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/event-recommendation-engine-challenge

1. Search operation: Show results for the keywords searched by users.
2. Event prediction: Predict if a person would be interested in an event and generate recommendations based on this prediction.
   a. Give personalized recommendations of events based on the likes/dislikes of students.
   b. In case of new user, predict based on interests provided by user and the other features such as age, gender, occupation.
3. Event Hosting: A user can create a new event.
4. Footfall Prediction: Once the user creates an event, MeetUp starts analyzing similar past events based on different features of the event and starts predicting footfall. This is also done runtime when users start registering for the event.
